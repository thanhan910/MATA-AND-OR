# Multiagent Task Allocation AND-OR

2023/24 Summer Research Project. 

In this project, we aim to extend the GreedyNE algorithm developed in Qinyuan Li's PhD thesis (2022, Bao Quoc Vo's PhD student) for multiagent task allocation problem to accommodate the scenarios where the tasks are inter-related and represented as an AND-OR goal tree. 

The Summer Project student is expected to implement a standard Branch-and-Bound algorithm and also develop a new heuristic-based approximate algorithm to efficiently solve the problem and compare the performance of the two algorithms.
